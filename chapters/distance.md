# Mirrors

1. Boy = Inventor who invented a trans-universal portal
     Girl = magician with a magic mirror
 2. Portal: constantly scans through all available frequencies 24/7
 3. Mirror: Constantly casting "is anyone there today?"
 4. Switch back and forth in dreams
 5. See each other in every reflective surface
 6. Story ends when they meet. Neither are real?
 7. Girl learns automation from the boy.
 8. Boy is inspired by girl

My entire life has been a fight against Apathy.

I spent the majority of my childhood looking for a challenge.
When I was in elementary school, I was told that certain books would be too challenging, so I read those books.
When I was in middle school, I was told programming was hard, so I learned how to program.
When I was in high school, I was told that research was impossible to understand, so I began reading the academic literature.

By the time I finished my PhD, there were no more challenges I could not understand.
Everything was trivial and I had exhausted the most interesting topics I could conceive of.

Even so, there was hope.

Just because humans had not come up with anything interesting yet, that did not mean there would not be something interesting in the future.
I just had to be the one to find it.
 
 As I closed the door behind me, my eyes adjusted to an all-too-familiar sight: a desk with an amber lamp casting light onto a simple keyboard and mouse, along with a few monitors flashing with code.
 On the far side of the room was a shelf, filled with an assortment of textbooks ranging from neuroscience to quantum field theory, many of which were tattered and worn from years of constant use.
There was a single open window on the far wall onlooking a field of tall grass that flowed gently in the wind, illuminated by moonlight and stars.
Below the window rested a workbench of sorts with a large metallic box emitting a mechanical hum along with periodic whirring.
The box had a glass screen and occassionally flashed from the inside, illuminating a few mechanical arms twisting and turning about, proding at a complex metallic circuit on the table.
Notes and annotated papers covered nearly every other open corner of the room, with certain stacks held in colored bins to uphold the semblance of order.

This was my workshop.
A lab of sorts where I do all my research.

See, research has been my singular focus for the greater part of 2 decades.
To me, there is nothing greater than pushing beyond the boundary of human knowledge and doing what has never been done before.

The boundary is a hard thing to properly describe.
In some places, it is distinct: we know what we don't know.
With a little work, these areas of human knowledge could be more or less complete.
In other places, however, the boundary is much more nebulous.
The more we probe, the less we know and the more we hope to understand.

Though scientists spend their time seeking known unknowns, the unknown unknowns are what truly create revolutions in the way humanity perceives the world around it.

Research is not always glamorous work.
Most of the time, it's just software engineering with additional steps.

Sure, sometimes my research involves hours, days, or even weeks of brute-foce computation, probing possibilities within the known unknown, hoping to break through into unknown unknowns and revolutionize how we 

A few years ago, I had finished my PhD and after that, I had the opportunity to work at some of the best research centers in the world.
During that time, I found myself struggling with constant apathy
 
 I sighed a bit and rubbed my temples.
 It was going to be another long night.
