# A note to the reader

Imagine a black expanse, dotted with a random assortment of blue bubbles.

I fundamentally believe that every person lives in their own little universe, almost completely disconnected from everyone else.
Each universe is constructed based on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that form that individual's experiences.
In many ways, I imagine these pocket universes all floating around in some common reality.

That is to say, when a new experience is shared by multiple people, it is seen differently depending on which pocket universe is observing it.
Think of light refracting as it enters water or glass.
Depending on the medium, light bends more or less.
Each universe is like a little droplet of some weird translucent liquid, and each person sees the world from within their own droplet.

I am doing a poor job of explaining this.

When I was younger, I would swim every single day.
I found it to be a nice escape from the mundane day-to-day experience of school and work and it was the only time I was able to slow the cogs of my own mind.
To me, swimming remains the only sport  I can completely physically exhaust myself with, which gives me no room to think about tedious minutiae that occurs throughout the day.
There's something about a long session of going back and forth in the same swimming lane for hours every day that allows me to be feel contemplative without actually contemplating anything.

Sometimes I'm lucky enough to be swimming in a nearly empty pool and as I push off the wall, I can glimpse upwards towards the surface of the water and examine my reflection on the surface.
Water is a weird substance.
If I focus on the surface, I can see my own image perfectly reflecting back, but if I look deeper, I can also see the world beyond -- distorted clouds drifting in the sky or the interior of a gym that doesn't quite look right.

I find the whole experience to be so surreal.
The world around me is no different than it was when I was on above the water, but because of gentle ripples on the surface, water, itself, bending light, and my own sheer exhaustion, everything feels completely different than before.

I feel this is how everyone sees the world.
They all live in their little droplet and must see past their reflection to make sense of a distorted reality beyond.

No one has a perfect view of the world.
Everyone is biased.

The only way to truly understand someone is to swim with them a little bit in their own distorted pocket universe.
After all, it is impossible to understand people without understanding the lens through which they see the world around them, and as such, I find myself constantly trying to dive deeper and deeper into their individual perspectives to see the world as they see it.
The act of communication is like swimming in some shared reality bubble for long enough to come to a mutual understanding.

The problem is that some bubbles are really far from other bubbles.
This means that for people to come to a mutual understanding, they both need to stretch their imaginations and really listen to each other.

Other bubbles are toxic to certain visitors.
Fresh water fish can't swim in salt water.

Conversation can only happen between two people that are willing to work together and share the same set of premises for at least a short amount of time.

The problem is that people are completely unaware of the bubbles they live in.
They assume that everyone else lives in the same way, sharing the same experiences.
Because of this, they are unwilling to swim outside of their comfort zone and truly understand others.

I guess my point is that people are people.
It's impossible to know why a person does any single action without learning a bit about the pocket universe they live in.

I also find that the more I learn about others, the more beautiful they become.

The trick is understanding that even though there is a shared reality, that reality is distorted by the eyes perceiving it.

When I was younger, I always struggled in explaining this to others.
In fact, reading through the weird pocket universe analogy I wrote above, I obviously still struggle with it.

The point is that I always find myself trying to justify the behaviour of other people.
No matter how much I was bullied, I would always try to understand *why* I was bullied.
What made my aggressor aggressive?
By asking this question, I managed to turn my bullies into lasting friendships that I still have to this day.

I also realized that truth is often relative.
Any person confident in their own truth must provide concrete evidence from multiple perspectives that that truth is true, otherwise, it is impossible to believe.

This is why I quickly gravitated towards scientific literature.
It always does whatever it can to lay out the foundations and perspective before moving on to its results.

This is also why I hate magic.
...

Again, though, when I was younger, I would often struggle with self-expression -- with showing people my own perspective.
I found that I struggled to explain my perspective to even myself.

That said, I was able to understand works of fiction and ended up writing short-stories during pivotal moments of my life as ways to explain the significance of the event.

The following anthology is a series of stories written throughout my life, all related to my relationship with the most important person in my life.
