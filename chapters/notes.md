# Mirrors

1. Boy = Inventor who invented a trans-universal portal
     Girl = magician with a magic mirror
 2. Portal: constantly scans through all available frequencies 24/7
 3. Mirror: Constantly casting "is anyone there today?"
 4. Switch back and forth in dreams
 5. See each other in every reflective surface
 6. Story ends when they meet. Neither are real?
 7. Girl learns automation from the boy.
 8. Boy is inspired by girl
 9. Boy waits weeks watching nothing but static because he's sure that *he* will be the one who figures out how to send information. He's expecting to see himself in the mirror, but instead finds the girl
